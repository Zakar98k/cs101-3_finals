        <h1>Top Albums :)</h1>
        <p>These are the rankings for my favorite albums. I mostly
          listen to metalcore, hardcore, and emo genres, and my favorite
          genre is melodic metalcore infused with emo.

        <h2>1. <i>Controller</i> — Misery Signals</h2>
        <img class="album-art" src="./images/controller.webp" alt="Controller - Misery Signals">
        <p>One of the albums that really shaped my music taste. It's just so crushing
          and dynamic at the same time. You wont hear these riffs anywhere else, they're just bursting with apocalyptic character and dread.

        <h2>2. <i>I'm So Bad With Goodbyes</i> — A Long Winter</h2>
        <img class="album-art" src="./images/im_so_bad_with_goodbyes.jpg" alt="I'm So Bad With Goodbyes - A Long Winter">
        <p> An underrated melodic-metalcore emo record that sounds different. It sounds very romantic
          and angelic, then it can switch up to hard chugs with panic chords.

        <h2>3. <i>You Come Before You</i> — Poison the Well</h2>
        <img class="album-art" src="./images/you_come_before_you.jpg" alt="You Come Before You - Poison The Well">
        <p>An emo masterclass. Bittersweet melodies that fall into place.
          Its sounds very pleasing and warm, and the metalcore parts are very blistering and groovy.
        </p>

        <h2>4. <i>Somewhere City</i> — Origami Angel</h2>
        <img class="album-art" src="./images/somewhere_city.jpg" alt="You Come Before You - Poison The Well">
        <p>This record feels like a friend you've known for a very long time. It's very fun
          and nostalgic sounding. It's amazing.

        <h2>5. <i>Pass the Flask</i> — The Bled</h2>
        <img class="album-art" src="./images/pass_the_flask.jpg" alt="Pass the Flask - The Bled">
        <p>Full of plenty addicting riffs. It's very post-hardcore, and chuggy, which
           makes for a fun listen.
