        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I'm Zach. I like Linux, programming and Tekken. Specifically, I want
          to get into software engineering for apps and websites. My other interests
          are anime & manga, listening to albums, and <a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn">ricing</a>.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>My interest for programming began when I wanted to make a game just like
          those old 2000s side-scrolling platformer flash games on Miniclip and Friv.
          I did a lot of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> when I was a kid, 
          then enrolled in <a href="https://www.edx.org/cs50/">CS50</a> when I wanted to
          take things more seriously.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>I like being around people who share my interests and inspire me to
          do more, although I'm not very good at keeping conversation.

        <h1>About The Site</h1>
        <p>This site was made for my finals on introduction to
          computing. I used VSCode IDE to edit HTML and CSS, as well as Open-props
          to style the elements.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Styling</h2>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://open-props.style/"></a>Open-props is a very modular CSS framework. It basically just 
        provides the values that you can then use to style your elements.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Color scheme</h2>
        <p>The color scheme I used is called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Biscuit-Theme/biscuit">Biscuit</a>.
            It's a warm and cozy dark colorscheme, which is perfect for what this site needs.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>For the font, I used <a target="_blank" href="https://hanken.co/products/hk-grotesk">HK Grotesk</a>. 
        It's a friendly but modern font, and kind of blends well with the color scheme.
        I also used <a target="_blank" href="https://transfonter.org/">Transfonter</a> to easily generate the font-kit to use for the website.</p>
